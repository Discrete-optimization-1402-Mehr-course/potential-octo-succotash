COP (Combinatorial Optimization Problem) model is a mathematical model used to solve combinatorial optimization problems. This model is based on the concept of combinatorics and graph theory.
Combinatorial optimization problems usually seek to find an optimal solution among a set of possible combinations and choices. To solve such problems, the COP model uses concepts and algorithms such as depth-first search, limited depth search, best-first search, iterative search, genetic algorithms, etc.

The code works as follows:
First, a city graph is created with a given number of nodes (bus stops) and bus lines (bus_lines). This graph is constructed using the barabasi_albert_graph function, which uses a stochastic model to generate scalable graphs.
For each edge (path between two stations) in the graph, a property named "length" is determined, which indicates the length of the path. This length is randomly selected within the specified range (EDGE_LENGTH_LIMITS).
Then, for each bus line, a random path is generated on the graph. This path is created using the random_path function. This function uses a graph and the maximum allowed path length (max_len) and generates a random path of nodes of the specified maximum length.
Then, consecutive pairs of stations on each route are selected and the bus lines that pass on that route are added to the "bus_line" attribute of each edge. If the "bus_line" attribute is already set for an edge, new bus lines are added to it.
Finally, the final urban graph with the generated bus lines is returned as output.
